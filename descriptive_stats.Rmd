## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

setwd("H:/Menu Labeling in California/CAmenulabeling")
getwd()

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

#install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)


df <- read.csv("ca_ds_223003.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

```{r}

#check that the number of restaurants is around 500
sqldf('select count(distinct restaurant_id) from CA_ds2') #575 restaurants

ggplot(df, aes(x=DW_MONTH)) + geom_histogram()

```
